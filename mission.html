        <h2>The Shop Values </h2>
    <p>With our partners, our coffee and our customers at our core, we live these values:

        Creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.
        
        Acting with courage, challenging the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other.
        
        Being present, connecting with transparency, dignity and respect.
        
        Delivering our very best in all we do, holding ourselves accountable for results.
        
        We are performance driven, through the lens of humanity.
